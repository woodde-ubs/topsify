# Topsify

Welcome to Topsify! We're a huge music streaming service with a global user base
and eye-watering amounts of data.

We're so glad you're here - corporate have been asking for reports, stats and
data, but the team is stretched thin at the moment trying to get the UI right.
Let's get working on the database straight away.

## Getting started

1. Make sure your machine is set up according to the instructions with

   - [bash](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/bash/)
   - [vscode](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/vscode/)
   - [git](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/git/)
   - [sqlite](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/sql/installation-linux.html)

1. Clone the repository (i.e. download it), so you have a copy on your machine.

1. Once cloned, open a terminal in the project folder, and run

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x ./test.sh
   ```

   to make the test script executable.

1. Install the recommended
   [Live Server extension](vscode:extension/ritwickdey.LiveServer)

## Running tests

To check if your deep dive tests pass, you can run:

```bash
./test.sh
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> Make sure you include the `./`, and that you run this from the project root
> directory.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can also specify the tests to run like so:
>
> ```bash
> ./test.sh 1a 1b 2a 2b 3a
> ```
